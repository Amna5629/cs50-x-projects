sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
The slower performance, especially with reversed input, suggests a less efficient algorithm like  Selection Sort.
These algorithms are known for their inefficiency for large datasets.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
The consistent performance across different input types, including reversed lists, and the faster timings compared to sort1 and sort3 strongly suggest the use of a more efficient algorithm like Merge Sort.
 Merge Sort is known for its efficiency, especially with larger datasets and various input orders.

sort3 uses:Selection sort

How do you know?:
The intermediate performance between sort1 and sort2 suggests a slightly more efficient algorithm than Bubble Sort.
